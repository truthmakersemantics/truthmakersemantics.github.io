      <description>2021  Routley Star and Hyperintensionality Sergei Odintsov and Heinrich Wansing  Publication details Compares HYPE to Heyting-Ockam logic. Contains a characterization of HYPE as identical to a modal system introduced by Moisil. From the perspective of truthmaker semantics, these results can be understood as results about (a certain kind of) inexact truthmaker semantics.
