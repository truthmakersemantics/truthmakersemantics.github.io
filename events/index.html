              </a>

                &#34;Upcoming - In great part through the work of Kit Fine,
                truthmaker semantics has recently been thoroughly developed and
                applied to many different topics, both within philosophy and in
                other areas. The aim of this workshop is to bring together
                people working on the foundations, development and applications
                of the framework, including researchers who are critical of it
                or who argue that its benefits can be had in other frameworks,
                for instance the framework of possible worlds semantics.&#34;

              <p>
                &#34;Truthmaker semantics deviates from the familiar framework
                of possible world semantics in two fundamental and related ways.
                First, the notion of a possible world is replaced by a more
                general notion of a state that applies to any fragment of a
                world. Second, a sentence is taken to be made true by a state
                only if every part of the state is involved in rendering the
                sentence true. A significant advantage of truthmaker semantics
                over the possible worlds approach is that it connects sentences
                with the worldly items that are directly relevant to their
                truth, thereby allowing important and intuitive hyperintensional
                distinctions to be drawn in a natural and formally elegant way.
                While the framework was originally developed as a semantics for
                relevant entailment by van Fraassen in the 1960s, recent
                developments have demonstrated its wide applicability in logic
                (e.g. deontic logic), metaphysics (e.g. ground), the philosophy
                of language and linguistics (e.g. subject matter,
                presupposition, counterfactuals), the philosophy of science
                (e.g. confirmation), and epistemology (e.g. belief
                revision).&#34;

              <p>
                &#34;Truthmaker semantics is an approach to semantics that has
                attracted a growing amount of interest in recent years. It takes
                the content of a statement to be given in terms of the states
                that exactly verify it, where this is taken to require that the
                state—roughly, a part or fragment of a world—be wholly relevant
                to the truth of the statement. The truthmaker approach allows
                one to draw a number of important hyperintensional distinctions
                that do not appear to be available to other approaches, like the
                more familiar possible world semantics. In this course, after an
                introduction to the history, the motivations, and the basic
                framework of truthmaker semantics, we will survey its
                applications to (i) deontic and imperative logic, (ii)
                conditionals, (iii) partial content, (iv) intuitionistic and
                relevance logic, (v) Bayesian epistemology and the theory of
                rational belief revision, as well as (vi) natural language
                semantics (attitude reports, modals, and intensional definite
                descriptions).&#34;
