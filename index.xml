      <description>The Truthmaker Semantics Workshop  Wednesday, December 11, 2019  Amsterdam Science Park, ILLC, Room F1.15  http://projects.illc.uva.nl/conceivability/Events/event/42/Truthmakers-Semantics-Workshop  Truthmaker Semantics. Applications in Philosophy and Linguistics  Monday, July 29, 2019 &amp;mdash; Wednesday, July 31, 2019   Truthmaker semantics deviates from the familiar framework of possible world semantics in two fundamental and related ways. First, the notion of a possible world is replaced by a more general notion of a state that applies to any fragment of a world.</description>
