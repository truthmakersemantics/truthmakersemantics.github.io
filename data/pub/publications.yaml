    the conflict-tolerant deontic logic **BDL** (bringing the long
    search for a semantics to an end). The clause for the obligation

    truthmaker framework into Modal Information Logic. It contains a
    very useful discussion of the result and possible ways in which
    truthmaker semantics and modal logic approaches can inform each
    other.

    presents an argument against the existence of non-obtaining states

    for relevance logic, based on/referencing ([@TMS:RESTEN] and

    whether the exactness idea plays an important role in the paper.
