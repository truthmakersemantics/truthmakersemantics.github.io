      "It is also important in applying the semantics to appreciate that the
      term ‘state’ is a mere term of art and need not be a state in any
      intuitive sense of the term. Thus facts or events or even ordinary
      individuals could, in principle, be taken to be states, as long as they
      are capa- ble of being endowed with the relevant mereological structure
      and can be properly regarded as verifiers. We allow the states, whatever
      they might be, to be possible as well as actual (as with Gore winning the
      presidency in 2001); and we even allow impossible states (as with Gore
      both winning and losing the presidency in 2001). Thus verification will
      have a coun- terfactual flavor; a verifying state is one that would make
      a given statement true were it to obtain, not necessarily one that does
      make the statement true. From a purely mathematical point of view, we may
      take a state space to be an ordered"

       "Loose verification is a purely modal notion. A state or situation s
       will loosely verify a statement just in case the state necessitates the
       statement, that is, just in case it is impossible that the state obtain
       and the statement not be true. Exact and inexact verification, by con-
       trast, require that there be a relevant connection between state and
       statement. With inexact"
