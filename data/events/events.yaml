  description  : "Truthmaker semantics is an approach to semantics that has attracted a growing amount of interest in recent years. It takes the content of a statement to be given in terms of the states that exactly verify it, where this is taken to require that the state—roughly, a  part or fragment of a world—be wholly relevant to the truth of the  statement. The truthmaker approach allows one to draw a number of important hyperintensional distinctions that do not appear to be available to other approaches, like the more familiar possible world semantics. In this course, after an introduction to the history, the motivations, and the basic framework of truthmaker semantics, we will survey its applications to (i) deontic and imperative logic, (ii) conditionals, (iii) partial content, (iv) intuitionistic and relevance logic, (v) Bayesian epistemology and the theory of rational belief revision, as well as (vi) natural language semantics (attitude reports, modals, and intensional definite descriptions)."

  description  : "Truthmaker semantics deviates from the familiar framework of possible world semantics in two fundamental and related ways. First, the notion of a possible world is replaced by a more general notion of a state that applies to any fragment of a world. Second, a sentence is taken to be made true by a state only if every part of the state is involved in rendering the sentence true. A significant advantage of truthmaker semantics over the possible worlds approach is that it connects sentences with the worldly items that are directly relevant to their truth, thereby allowing important and intuitive hyperintensional distinctions to be drawn in a natural and formally elegant way. While the framework was originally developed as a semantics for relevant entailment by van Fraassen in the 1960s, recent developments have demonstrated its wide applicability in logic (e.g. deontic logic), metaphysics (e.g. ground), the philosophy of language and linguistics (e.g. subject matter, presupposition, counterfactuals), the philosophy of science (e.g. confirmation), and epistemology (e.g. belief revision)."
