      Fabrice Correia: <em>Factual Equivalence, One-sided vs Two-sided</em>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Abstract
        </summary>
        <p>
        <em>
        I have developed elsewhere a conception of grounding according to which
        grounding is closed under factual equivalence. My favourite logic of factual
        equivalence has recently been criticised, independently by (in chronological
        order) Peter Fritz, Lisa Vogt and Benjamin Brast-McKie, on the grounds that it
        makes negation an opaque operator. I will diffuse the objection by arguing that
        rather than being a problem, the fact that negation is opaque for factual
        equivalence is to be expected. Part of the source of the objectors’
        dissatisfaction with my logic of factual equivalence, I think, is that they
        take for granted that factual equivalence is a form of identity. I will argue
        that it is not, but that a close cousin of it – which I dub “two-sided factual
        equivalence”, reserving “one-sided factual equivalence” for the former notion –
        plausibly is. I will then discuss the logic of two-sided factual equivalence,
        and its connection to what is often called “higher-order identity”.

      Cian Dorr (joint work with Ethan Russo): <em>Truthmaker Semantics as
        Metaphysics</em>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Abstract
        </summary>
        <em>
            <p>
            In a series of recent papers, Kit Fine [e.g., Fine 2016; 2017a,b]
            has developed and explored several forms of “truthmaker semantics”
            (TMS). Narrowly understood, TMS is just a collection of mathematical
            definitions of certain models for certain formal languages. While
            such models might be interesting in many different ways, one might
            be interested in them because one took them to provide an accurate
            account of reality, in the sense that every sentence true in every
            model in the class is really true.
            </p>
            <p>
            One simple language of particular interest to metaphysicians is the
            language of propositional logic supplemented with propositional
            quantifiers and identity: call it $\mathcal{L}_{\forall=}$. Although
            Fine’s papers mostly treat less expressive languages, TMS can
            readily be extended to interpret $\mathcal{L}_{\forall=}$; and on
            any way of doing this meeting certain very minimal desiderata,
            sentences like $\forall p(p=(p\lor q))$ and $\forall p\forall
            q\forall r((p\land (q\lor r))=((p\land q)\lor(p\land r)))$ will be
            true in all truthmaker models. We take these sentences to express
            very general and potentially controversial claims about reality (see
            Dorr 2016), to which those who accept the truthmaker models as
            metaphysically accurate will be committed.One of our goals in this
            paper is to map out the metaphysical commitments of various versions
            of truthmaker semantics expressible in $\mathcal{L}_{\forall=}$.
            </p>
            <p>
            Of course, the project of extracting metaphysics from TMS need not
            be limited to accepting sentences of this spare language. If one
            takes the models to be good pictures of the structure of reality,
            one will be tempted to start using the characteristic terminology of
            truthmaker semantics— ‘state’, ‘verify’, ‘obtain’...—not just for
            characterizing arbitrary set-theoretic models, but in an
            unrelativized way, to talk about the supposed structure in reality
            corresponding to the structure of such models. (Such a person might
            ask, e.g., not ‘How many states in this model are verifiers for the
            sentence “Snow is white”?’, but unrelativized questions like ‘How
            many states are verifiers for snow being white?’) Opponents,
            however, might question the very intelligibility of the new
            primitives (‘state’, etc.). One way to defuse such worries is to
            provide definitions of the novel terminology in terms of less
            controversial vocabulary that is common currency between truthmaker
            metaphysicians and their opponents, such as that of
            $\mathcal{L}_{\forall=}$.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our paradigm for this investigation is work done in the 1970s on
            possible worlds semantics, in particular Fine 1970 and Fine 2005
            (1977). Here, too, technical terms like 'world' first appear as
            nothing more than suggestive labels for certain ingredients of some
            mathematical models. But these models suggest a certain metaphysical
            theory, one that is 'coarser-grained' than the one suggested by
            truthmaker semantics in that it includes identities like $\forall p
            \forall q (p = p \lor (q \land \neg q))$. In spelling out this
            theory, it is natural to use expressions like 'world' and 'true at'
            in an unrelativized way. But thanks in large part to Prior and Fine,
            we know that in the context of the theory, adequate definitions of
            these theoretical terms can be given in $L^{\forall=}$. For example,
            '$w$ is a world' can be defined as '$w$ is a disjunctive atom', i.e.
            $\forall p (p \leq q \to (p = w \lor \forall q (p \leq_\lor q)))$
            (where $p \leq_\lor q$ means that $p$ is a disjunct of $q$, i.e. $q
            = q \lor p$). Given these definitions, the whole metaphysical theory
            of worlds can be derived from a few rather simple and independently
            appealing principles stated in $L_{\forall=}$.
            </p>
            <p>
            This paper carries out a similar program for some of the main
            versions of TMS. We begin with a 'unilateral' version of the
            semantics where propositions are modeled as sets of states meeting
            certain well-behavedness conditions (nonempty and regular). We show
            that in these models, the disjunctive atoms are exactly the
            singletons of states, so that one can define '$s$ is a state' as
            '$s$ is a disjunctive atom', and '$s$ verifies $p$' as '$s$ is a
            disjunct of $p$'. We formulate somewhat natural principles in
            $L_{\forall=}$ from which, with these definitions, one can derive
            that $p = q$ iff $p$ and $q$ have the same verifiers, and further
            derive principles about the verifiers of conjunctions, disjunctions,
            and negations corresponding to the semantic clauses of the relevant
            family of models.
            </p>
            <p>
            Having explored the version of TMS with unilateral, nonempty,
            regular propositions, we turn more briefly to two other versions:
            first, a version with unilateral propositions that may be empty or
            non-regular, and second, a bilateral version where propositions are
            modeled as ordered pairs of (nonempty and regular) sets of states.
            The former case is fairly straightforward, but the latter case turns
            out to be much more complicated, since states can no longer be
            identified with disjunctive atoms (since disjunctive atoms can have
            more than one verifier). We formulate more complex definitions of
            'state' and 'verify' in $L_{\forall=}$ which work for a class of
            bilateral models where the state space and domain of proposition are
            subject to certain further constraints.

    <details>
      <summary>
        Abstract
      </summary>
      I introduce the notion of a negative individual within a compositional system
      of truthmaker semantics for a fragment of the English language that involves logical
      connectives and quantifiers. The system allows for determiner phrases of all stripes to
      signify ‘menus’ compiled of positive, negative, or hybrid
      entities. Through a new compositional method, the negation contributed by a
      non-positive entity is able to pass through a semantic derivation in a well-behaved way.
      Although my focus is on negation, the primary application of this article pertains to the
      debate between the collective “non-Boolean” theory of conjunction based on plurality
      formation versus the traditional intersective “Boolean” theory based on logical
      conjunction. I demonstrate how a collective conjunction can be integrated with my
      semantics for negation to yield appropriate truthmakers for sentences that involve
      coordinations with non-upward entailing determiner phrases, which have previously
      been considered one of the toughest challenges for the collective theory.

        <p>
        <em>
        I distinguish between two notions of the subject matter of a sentence:
        internal and external. The internal subject matter constitutes the
        ways in which a sentence can be true. It is naturally captured by
        truthmaker semantics and related approaches, but it is harder to
        find using more traditional semantic machinery. The external notion
        of subject matter is the topic a sentence addresses, regardless of
        how it is true. I try to assess which notion plays a more central
        role in natural language semantics and pragmatics.
